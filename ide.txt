Ideas:
1. Look for key words like next, last, from etc. If the sentence contains next, we are looking at i++ instance of something. If it is next week, or one week from today, we are looking at day + 7. we can use a function for words like these such that we can call the next funciton and it determines what next thing we are talking about. It then returns the type or class of that thing and we can proceed accordingly.
